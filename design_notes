Body sections:
Header, Hero, Information, Quotes, CalltoAction, Footer

Header and Footer are same size and colors
Hero, Info, Quotes, C2A are same size

All sections have uniform left/right padding to narrow the content
Make all sections wrap to be responsive?
Maybe even make different layouts per screen size if feeling saucy

    Prep header-logo for image?

    Left hero all html or more divs (in column)?
    Right hero image - static size

    info-content is 4 images and text - refer to exercise for layouts
